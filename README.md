# Fake-News-Detection

Fake News is a spread of disinformation and hoaxes through any news platform. The imminent threat of such a widespread misinformation is obvious and hence we have looked into ways in which such Fake News can be identified with the help of Artificial Intelligence. Fake News Detection and analysis is an open challenge in AI!

# Description
Fake news is the intentional broadcasting of false or misleading claims as news, where the statements are purposely deceitful.

Newspapers, tabloids, and magazines have been supplanted by digital news platforms, blogs, social media feeds, and a plethora of mobile news applications. News organizations benefitted from the increased use of social media and mobile platforms by providing subscribers with up-to-the-minute information.

Consumers now have instant access to the latest news. These digital media platforms have increased in prominence due to their easy connectedness to the rest of the world and allow users to discuss and share ideas and debate topics such as democracy, education, health, research, and history. Fake news items on digital platforms are getting more popular and are used for profit, such as political and financial gain.

# Solution
It is vital to recognize and differentiate between false and accurate news. One method is to have an expert decide, and fact checks every piece of information, but this takes time and needs expertise that cannot be shared. Secondly, we can use machine learning and artificial intelligence tools to automate the identification of fake news.

Online news information includes various unstructured format data (such as documents, videos, and audio), but we will concentrate on text format news here. With the progress of machine learning and Natural language processing, we can now recognize the misleading and false character of an article or statement.

Our main goal is :

1. Explore and analyze the Fake News dataset.

2. Build a classifier that can distinguish Fake news with as much accuracy as possible.

# Results
As a result we get an accuracy score of  0.9865 of the training dataset which is something around 99 % and also we calculated the accuracy score of the test dataset which is around 0.9790 that means almost 98 % we get the correct result. As per the accuracy score we can say that farmost the code is working properly and generating accurate / correct results. 

# Conclusions
If you have a custom fake news dataset for fine-tuning, you simply have to pass a list of samples to the tokenizer as we did, you won't change / need any other code after that.
