# Description
Fake news is the intentional broadcasting of false or misleading claims as news, where the statements are purposely deceitful.

Newspapers, tabloids, and magazines have been supplanted by digital news platforms, blogs, social media feeds, and a plethora of mobile news applications. News organizations benefitted from the increased use of social media and mobile platforms by providing subscribers with up-to-the-minute information.

Consumers now have instant access to the latest news. These digital media platforms have increased in prominence due to their easy connectedness to the rest of the world and allow users to discuss and share ideas and debate topics such as democracy, education, health, research, and history. Fake news items on digital platforms are getting more popular and are used for profit, such as political and financial gain.
